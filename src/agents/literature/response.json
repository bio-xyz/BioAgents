However, several challenges limit the efficacy of dietary modifications in cancer therapy. This review explores how cancer cells acquire and catabolize macromolecules to harness energy and assesses the feasibility of influencing these pathways through dietary changes. Although dietary interventions modulate the energetic substrate supply to tumors only to a limited extent, they offer significant ancillary benefits by imposing hormonal states that burden cancer metabolism, enhancing immune responses, and reducing inflammation. Integrating dietary considerations into the standard of care for cancer patients represents a promising adjunct to traditional treatments, despite their dampened impact on nutrient availability for tumor energy metabolism.\n\nOncology nurses provide relational care with patients and families that require high levels of skill and empathy. This emotionally demanding work can lead to compassion fatigue, burnout, and unprocessed grief. Strategies to support oncology nurses are crucial for maintaining their well-being and delivering high-quality care. The purpose of this study was to analyze stories written by oncology nurses to understand the emotional experiences of caring for people with cancer.\n\nThis study aims to describe the characteristics of patients with simultaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) and lung cancer and to assess the impact of diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) and treatment choices on outcomes.\n\nLysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is a key enzyme involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, and its high expression is associated with cancer progression. This study aims to assess the relationship between LOXL2 expression and clinical prognosis in cancer patients through meta-analysis and bioinformatics. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases until December 2023. Studies reporting the relationship between LOXL2 expression and overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) were included. Hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. A total of 30 studies with 5021 patients were included. High LOXL2 expression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.65-2.23, P < 0.001) and DFS (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.39-2.36, P < 0.001). LOXL2 expression correlated with several clinicopathological features, including tumor size (OR = 1.53, P = 0.006), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.71, P = 0.016), and distant metastasis (OR = 2.63, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these results. High LOXL2 expression is a reliable prognostic biomarker for various cancers, correlating with poor survival outcomes and advanced clinical features. LOXL2 may serve as a therapeutic target to improve cancer prognosis and treatment.\n\nMetastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death and involves biological processes such as genomic instability and immune evasion. Although metastatic tumors generally retain major alterations present in primary tumors, the extent of additional genomic divergence across cancer types remains insufficiently characterized.\n\nSecondary leukemia often occurs as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), but is rare in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with secondary CML in B-lymphoid blast phase 12 years after the onset of mucinous gland carcinoma of unknown origin. After resection of the carcinoma, he received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He achieved a major molecular response with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and hyper CVAD/MA therapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in deep molecular response (DMR) approximately 1 year after the start of treatment. Twenty-six months later, he continues to maintain DMR under treatment with asciminib. Although the development of secondary CML is very rare, CML incidence is higher in patients with a history of cancer treatment. Consequently, it is important to be aware the risk of not only MDS/AML but also CML in this group.\n\nAdipose tissue has emerged as a prognostic factor in rectal cancer (RC), yet its metabolic role in tumour progression remains poorly understood. This study aims to characterise the metabolic profiles of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in early and advanced tumours to investigate metabolic alterations that may influence tumour progression. Understanding these alterations could provide insights into mechanisms of rectal cancer and identify therapeutic targets.\n\nCanine malignant melanoma (CMM) is a highly aggressive tumor with limited treatment options. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have shown promise in cancer therapy by modulating gene expression. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of an HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, on CMM cell lines. Vorinostat significantly suppressed cell proliferation through apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in vitro. These findings suggest that vorinostat might serve as a potential therapeutic agent for dogs with CMM, providing a basis for further in vivo studies.",

          "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, primarily due to treatment failure associated with metastasis and recurrence driven by chemoresistant cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). Annexin A1 (Anx-A1) is implicated in regulating apoptosis and autophagy, two crucial mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance. However, the precise role of Anx-A1 in modulating these mechanisms in CRC CSCs, specifically via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, is not well understood. This study aimed to explore the role of Anx-A1 in modulating apoptosis-autophagy interplay in a 5-FU-resistant colorectal CSC model using HCT 116, particularly through its regulatory effects on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. A 5-FU-resistant CRC CSC model was developed by sequentially exposing HCT 116 cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The model was characterized by assessing CSC markers (CD133, ALDH1, ABCG2, Oct-3/4) via flow cytometry and Simple Western analysis. Anx-A1 knockdown and overexpression were performed using siRNA and expression plasmids, respectively. Chemosensitivity was evaluated through cell viability assays, while apoptosis and autophagy markers were assessed by caspase assays, proteome profiler arrays, Western blotting, and autophagy flux analysis. The expression levels of PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, and mTOR were quantified using Simple Western analysis. The 5-FU-resistant HCT 116 demonstrated significantly elevated IC",

However, real-world validation of these models against multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB) recommendations-particularly in breast cancer treatment-remains limited. This retrospective study assessed the concordance between GPT-4o and the decisions of a breast cancer MTB over a six-month period. Thirty-three patients were included. Structured clinical data were entered into GPT-4o using standardized prompts, and treatment plans were generated in two independent sessions per case. Seven therapeutic domains were evaluated: surgery, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, genetic counseling/testing, and dual HER2-targeted therapy. Two blinded reviewers scored concordance using a 5-point Likert scale. Inter-rater reliability and classification metrics were calculated. GPT-4o generated consistent recommendations across both sessions for all patients. Full concordance (5/5) with MTB decisions was observed in 31 of 33 cases (93.9%), while partial concordance (4/5) occurred in 2 cases (6.1%) due to differences regarding genetic counseling. Inter-rater agreement was perfect (Cohen's kappa = 1.00), and the mean concordance score was 4.94 out of 5. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 93.9%, precision of 93.9%, recall of 100%, and F1 score of 96.8%. GPT-4o demonstrated a high level of agreement with expert multidisciplinary decisions in breast cancer care when provided with structured clinical input. These findings support its potential as a reproducible, guideline-consistent decision-support tool in oncology workflows.",

These processes can either promote tumor evasion and metastasis or mount effective anti-tumor responses, thereby determining the overall tumor landscape. At the center of this dynamic interplay are exosomes that facilitate crucial intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. While the roles of individual TME components in cancer progression have been extensively characterized, the precise mechanisms through which the reprogramming of these elements favors tumor advancement remain inadequately elucidated. This review investigates the complex functions of exosomal signaling in the reprogramming and polarization of TME constituents, highlighting their dual capacity to orchestrate tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing signals. This synthesis aims to elucidate how the modulation of TME cell behavior impacts cancer progression and contributes to the broader understanding of tumor biology.",

          "abstract": "Brain invasion is an independent diagnostic criterion for WHO grade 2 meningiomas, and preoperative prediction of brain invasion in meningiomas is crucial for guiding treatment decisions. Therefore, we constructed a radiomics model that integrated structural and diffusion-weighted images to predict brain invasion of meningiomas. Seven hundred and twenty-three consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed meningiomas between 2013 and 2022 were retrospectively studied. Radiomics features of the brain-to-tumor interface region were extracted from structural MRI and DWI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was utilized to select radiomics features. A linear predictor of brain invasion was constructed using a logistic regression classifier. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to evaluate the clinical utility of the established models. A nomogram was developed for a combined model that incorporates clinical features, along with radiomics scores derived from structural images and ADC maps. DeLong test and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to compare the diagnostic efficiency of different models. Six radiomics features from structural MRI, six radiomics features from ADC, the volume of peritumoral edema, and gender were selected to construct the combined model. This model achieved the highest AUC and sensitivity for predicting brain invasion in both the training (AUC = 0.897, 95%CI: 0.857 to 0.936, sensitivity = 0.911) and test sets (AUC = 0.871, 95%CI: 0.806 to 0.936, sensitivity = 0.895). It outperformed the structural model (AUC = 0.691) and the structural and clinical model (AUC = 0.812). The IDI demonstrated a significant improvement in predictive value when ADC radiomic features were added to the combined model. The incorporation of ADC radiomics into the MRI radiomic model improved the diagnostic performance for identifying brain invasion in meningiomas.",

Plasma-based transcriptomic profiling offers a less-invasive alternative for detecting cancer biomarkers compared to tissue-based methods. Unlike traditional tissue biopsies, plasma-based analyses enable easier, repeatable sampling and real-time disease monitoring through liquid biopsy. Despite its clinical potential, plasma transcriptomics remain underutilized due to technical limitations such as RNA degradation, low yield, and lack of standardized protocols. This review presents a comprehensive overview of current transcriptomic technologies including high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq), single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics, and evaluates their suitability for plasma-based applications. This review also discusses the analytical workflows used to process transcriptomic data, including differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network mapping, as well as tool for assessing biomarker performance through ROC curves and survival analysis. Furthermore, this review highlights emerging trends in integrative analysis, such as meta-analysis and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted multiomics integration, which significantly enhance biomarker discovery and therapeutic target identification. The review also outlines critical challenges in plasma transcriptomic profiling and proposes strategies for advancing the field toward clinical translation. Overall, this review aims to equip cancer researchers and clinicians with foundational knowledge and practical insights into plasma-based transcriptomics, reinforcing its potential in precision oncology and non-invasive cancer diagnostic.",

          "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by profound lipid metabolic dysregulation, yet the mechanisms linking peritumoral adipose tissue (PAT)-derived lipid metabolites to tumor aggressiveness remain poorly defined. Here, we identified lysophosphatidylethanolamine 18:1 (LPE18:1), a lipid metabolite enriched in PAT and the arterial blood of ccRCC patients, as a critical driver of tumor growth and lipid deposition. Through multiomics analyses and functional studies, we demonstrated that LPE18:1 upregulates F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-1 (CAPZA1), which recruits ubiquitin-specific peptidase 48 (USP48) to stabilize the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-6 (SIRT6) by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. Increased SIRT6 epigenetically promotes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) expression, redirecting lipid metabolism toward free cholesterol accumulation-a hallmark of ccRCC aggressiveness. Clinically, CAPZA1 and SIRT6 levels correlate with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in ccRCC cohorts. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the CAPZA1/SIRT6 axis can reverse LPE18:1-induced lipid deposition and tumor progression in xenograft models. Notably, targeting this axis with the SIRT6 inhibitor OSS-128167 combined with CAPZA1 depletion significantly suppresses ccRCC cell growth. Our study reveals a PAT-derived lipid metabolite-fuelled signaling cascade that reprograms lipid metabolism in ccRCC, identifying CAPZA1/USP48/SIRT6 as actionable therapeutic targets for metabolic malignancies.",

Nevertheless, the role of EPDR1, a family of glycoproteins involved in cell-cell contact, to gastric cancer (GC) remain unknown. Here, we determined that EPDR1 is significantly upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, and is associated with poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo functional assays demonstrate that EPDR1 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. Mechanistically, EPDR1 regulates the expression level of CPT1A, thereby mediating metabolic reprogramming of the fatty acid oxidation pathway. Our RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments show that CPT1A interacts with STAT3 in GC cell lines, and that EPDR1 mediates the phosphorylation of STAT3 via CPT1A. Overall, our work elucidates that EPDR1 activates the JAK-STAT pathway through the regulation of CPT1A, leading to enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3 and promoting fatty acid oxidation levels in GC, thus facilitating the progression of gastric cancer and providing a potential therapeutic target for its treatment.",

At the same time, the influence of internalized NPs on SCs properties, namely, their homing, migration ability, and functioning, remains scarcely investigated. Here, H1 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) labeled with visible (Vis) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent NPs are studied in vitro, focusing on the NPs internalization and release efficiency, cytocompatibility, intracellular distribution, as well as the migration ability of hESCs carrying NPs. Polymeric NPs with a polystyrene (PolySt) core and a shell of co-polymer of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and acrylamide (AA), [Poly(NIPAM-co-AA)] and with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 155 nm are loaded with pyrromethene dye with visible fluorescence peaked at ~ 560 nm (Vis-NPs) or with a NIR dye emitting at ~ 900-1150 nm (NIR-NPs) and comparatively studied. PolySt-Poly(NIPAM-co-AA) core-shell NPs were found to reveal a 57 and 37% increase in size after NIR dye and Vis dye loading, respectively. The study of the dependence of NPs size distribution on temperature demonstrates that NPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability through the explored temperature range (i.e., 25-60 °C), including physiological temperatures. The dye-loaded NPs are efficiently internalized by the targeted cells, mainly localizing within lysosomal compartments, and exhibit negligible toxicity. A sequential fluorescence-based study of extracellular dye release kinetics shows that free dye molecules are released from hESCs much faster than the dye initially loaded to NPs. Finally, hESCs internalized with dye-loaded NPs retain good migration ability and demonstrate tropism toward inflammatory stimuli in an in vitro transwell migration assay (Boyden chamber), revealing a good potential towards targeting neuroinflammation in vivo.",

To investigate how canonical glioblastoma mutations promote functional plasticity, we have developed an isogenic human neural stem cell (NSC) model of glioblastoma by sequential addition of TERT promoter, TP53, and PDGFRA point mutations. TP53 loss-of-function increases TERT expression during serial mutagenesis, but only triple mutant NSCs reliably form lethal brain tumors in vivo that recapitulate glioblastoma. Tumor cell evolution triggers stress-related metabolic changes and transitions toward a neuronal progenitor network driven by transcription factor INSM1. INSM1 is highly expressed in human glioblastoma tumors and, during cortical development, in intermediate progenitor cells, which give rise to neurons. Remarkably, INSM1 knockdown in triple mutant NSCs and primary glioblastoma cells disrupts oncogenic gene expression and function and inhibits the in vivo tumorigenicity of triple mutant NSCs, highlighting the functional importance of an intermediate progenitor cell-like cell state in glioblastoma pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a highly lethal gynecologic malignancy characterized by substantial molecular heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges. Although many reviews examine specific aspects of OC biology or treatment, few attempt to connect recent findings into a broader and coherent picture. This review provides an integrated and forward-looking synthesis of emerging mechanisms and therapeutic trends in OC, understanding OC progression and therapeutic resistance. Unique contributions of this review include providing a unified interpretation of emerging multi-omics evidence that reshapes the biological understanding of individual OC histotypes, delineating key metabolic dependencies such as glutamine addiction, aberrant lipid remodeling, glycolytic plasticity and purine pathway rewiring as potential therapeutic entry points, and elucidating how ascites-driven immune dysfunction remodels antitumor immunity to ultimately influence the effectiveness of cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer therapies. Additionally, the review articulates underexplored therapeutic intersections, including nanotechnology-enhanced immunotherapy, gene-editing nanocarriers, and microbiome-mediated modulation of drug sensitivity and immune activation. By integrating these diverse yet interconnected domains, this review proposes updated conceptual models and cross-therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming chemoresistance and advancing precision, personalized treatment paradigms in OC.",

This study aims to assess the relationship between LOXL2 expression and clinical prognosis in cancer patients through meta-analysis and bioinformatics. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases until December 2023. Studies reporting the relationship between LOXL2 expression and overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) were included. Hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. A total of 30 studies with 5021 patients were included. High LOXL2 expression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.65-2.23, P < 0.001) and DFS (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.39-2.36, P < 0.001). LOXL2 expression correlated with several clinicopathological features, including tumor size (OR = 1.53, P = 0.006), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.71, P = 0.016), and distant metastasis (OR = 2.63, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these results. High LOXL2 expression is a reliable prognostic biomarker for various cancers, correlating with poor survival outcomes and advanced clinical features.

          "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are pivotal in facilitating the progression of cancer cells. M1 and M2 are two polarization states of TAMs with opposite functions in tumor progression. While the regulatory role of N6-adenosine (m6A) methylation in macrophage polarization has been established, the function of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) remains unclear. The presence of M2 macrophages in bladder cancer and adjacent normal tissues was validated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence (IF). The expression of reported m5C regulators (writers, readers, erasers) was screened in M2 macrophages to identify the most relevant regulators. Mechanistic insights into how m5C methylation regulates macrophage polarization were gained through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and quantitative PCR. The FACS and IF results revealed that the main active state of the tumor microenvironment (TME) was the M2 subtype in bladder cancer. Next, NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2) was identified as the most upregulated RNA m5C methylase in M2 via a qPCR assay. According to whole-transcriptome resequencing in si-NSUN2 RAW/THP-1 cells and GO analysis, SOCS3 was determined to be downstream of NSUN2. By methylating particular sites in SOCS3 mRNA, NSUN2 inhibits both the stability and nuclear export of SOCS3 mRNA, which subsequently activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and then promotes macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype while inhibiting M1 polarization. Additionally, this process involves the assistance and balance of the reader YBX1 and the eraser TET2. NSUN2 methylates SOCS3 mRNA to inhibit its stability and nuclear export, which consequently promotes macrophage polarization to M2.",

          "abstract": "Identifying novel molecular targets for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is crucial. This study examines the expression and functional role of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A (SNRPA), a core component of the U1 snRNP complex, in CRPC. Bioinformatics analyses indicate a positive correlation between SNRPA overexpression and the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, with high levels linked to poor outcomes. Single-cell RNA data further shows increased SNRPA expression in prostate cancer cells. Expression of SNRPA is also elevated in both locally-treated CRPC tissues and various CRPC cells. Knockdown via shRNA or knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly reduced cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRPC cells, while inducing apoptosis. SNRPA depletion decreased complex I activity, ATP production, and mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species levels, and downregulated NDUFB8/NDUFS9 expression. In contrast, SNRPA overexpression enhanced the aggressive phenotype of CRPC cells, boosting mitochondrial complex I activity and ATP generation, while upregulating NDUFB8/NDUFS9. In vivo studies using xenograft models further validated the therapeutic potential of targeting SNRPA. SNRPA knockdown significantly inhibited CRPC xenograft growth, reduced ATP levels, and altered redox balance, as evidenced by decreased glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio and increased lipid peroxidation. These effects were accompanied by decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis and downregulated NDUFB8/NDUFS9. Our findings collectively suggest that SNRPA plays a crucial role in driving CRPC progression and represents a promising therapeutic target.",

How chemotherapeutic nucleoside 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG) targets telomerase to inhibit telomere maintenance in cancer cells and tumors was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that telomerase insertion of 6-thio-dGTP prevents synthesis of additional telomeric repeats but does not disrupt telomerase binding to telomeres. Specifically, 6-thio-dG inhibits telomere extension after telomerase translocates along its product DNA to reposition the template, inducing a non-productive complex rather than enzyme dissociation. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that 6-thio-dG treatment inhibits telomere synthesis by telomerase in cancer cells. In agreement, telomerase-expressing cancer cells harboring critically short telomeres are more sensitive to 6-thio-dG and show a greater induction of telomere losses compared to cancer cells with long telomere reserves. Our studies reveal that telomere length and telomerase status determine 6-thio-dG sensitivity and uncover the molecular mechanism by which 6-thio-dG selectively inhibits telomerase synthesis of telomeric DNA.",

          "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a poor prognostic disease, especially in BRCA1/2 wild-type (BRCA-WT) patients with homologous recombination (HR) proficiency. These patients often show limited response to both platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. HR and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are the two major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. HR is a precise repair mechanism for DSBs but is limited to S and G2 phases. In contrast, NHEJ functions more broadly throughout the cell cycle, including G1. We investigated whether inhibiting the G2/M checkpoint kinases PLK1 or WEE1 individually could disrupt mitotic control and expose therapeutic vulnerabilities in BRCA-WT/HR-proficient HGSOC cells. We evaluated cell cycle-targeted strategies to overcome HR-proficient chemoresistance using either volasertib (a selective PLK1 inhibitor) or adavosertib (a potent WEE1 inhibitor) in BRCA-WT/HR-proficient and BRCA-mutant/HR-deficient HGSOC models. Both agents induced DNA damage, impaired HR repair (reduced RAD51 foci), and triggered mitotic catastrophe-a form of cell death caused by defective mitosis and unresolved DNA damage-in BRCA-WT cells. Volasertib caused polyploidy and abnormal spindle formation, indicating mitotic slippage and cytokinesis failure, whereas adavosertib abrogated the G2/M checkpoint, forcing premature mitotic entry. In contrast, BRCA-mutant cells were resistant to either volasertib or adavosertib, consistent with sustained and functional NHEJ activity. This resistance was restored by the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit), a prominent component of NHEJ. Functional and xenograft models confirmed selective vulnerability of BRCA-WT tumors to either PLK1 or WEE1 inhibition. Our work highlights a mechanistic framework linking cell cycle checkpoint inhibition to DNA repair pathway selectivity, providing a rationale for targeting mitotic regulators in HR-proficient ovarian cancer-a subgroup with high clinical unmet need.",

Here, through a targeted siRNA screen of 40 RBM family members, we identified RNA-binding motif protein 8 A (RBM8A) as central orchestrator of oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage in gastric cancer (GC). Functional studies demonstrated that RBM8A promotes tumor proliferation and chemoresistance by recruiting the RNA helicase eIF4A3 to stabilize epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA, shielding it from exonucleolytic degradation. This stabilization sustains EGFR protein levels, enabling nuclear EGFR-DNA-PKcs complex formation to drive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair and suppress oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Therapeutic targeting of this axis with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib restored oxaliplatin sensitivity in vitro and synergistically suppressed RBM8A-driven xenograft growth in vivo. Additionally, single-cell RNA-seq revealed RBM8A enrichment in malignant gastric epithelial cells, while tissue microarrays confirmed that dual RBM8A/EGFR overexpression predicts the poorest survival outcomes. Collectively, our findings define the RBM8A-eIF4A3-EGFR axis as a druggable determinant of chemoresistance and establish RBM8A as both a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in GC.",

Although dietary interventions modulate the energetic substrate supply to tumors only to a limited extent, they offer significant ancillary benefits by imposing hormonal states that burden cancer metabolism, enhancing immune responses, and reducing inflammation. Integrating dietary considerations into the standard of care for cancer patients represents a promising adjunct to traditional treatments, despite their dampened impact on nutrient availability for tumor energy metabolism.",

A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 12 patients diagnosed with bladder diverticular carcinoma who were treated at Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University between January 2016 and May 2023. All patients underwent laparoscopic partial cystectomy. The study assessed surgical parameters (e.g., operation time, intraoperative blood loss), pathological findings (tumor grade, stage, surgical margin status), postoperative complications, adjuvant treatment regimens, and long-term follow-up outcomes (tumor recurrence, survival status). All 12 operations were completed successfully without major intraoperative complications. Postoperative pathology confirmed bladder urothelial carcinoma in all cases, with negative surgical margins in all patients. Postoperatively, all patients received regular intravesical instillation chemotherapy. Additionally, 5 patients underwent systemic intravenous chemotherapy, and 1 patient received intra-arterial chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence. The median follow-up duration was 16-49 months. During follow-up, 11 patients remained free of tumor recurrence, while 1 patient developed recurrent bladder cancer at 15 months postoperatively (subsequently managed with transurethral resection of bladder tumor and adjuvant radiotherapy, achieving long-term survival). Laparoscopic partial cystectomy is a safe and effective therapeutic option for bladder diverticular carcinoma, characterized by low postoperative complication rates and favorable tumor control. Larger-sample, multi-center studies with longer follow-up are needed to further validate its long-term prognostic benefits.",

Notably, the presence of the pks island and elevated abundance of Enterobacteriaceae were linked to poor prognosis specifically in CMS2 tumors. Finally, microbial risk scores derived from taxa present in tumor or NATs predicted patient prognosis independently of established clinico-molecular factors. Prognostic taxa were strongly associated with tumor transcriptomic pathways related to hypoxia, immune response, and metabolic status.

Diverse effector proteins or domains are found to associate with retrons, typically forming tripartite toxin-antitoxin systems involved in anti-phage defense. Although retrons have attracted growing interest in genome editing technologies, the mechanisms underlying most retron-mediated immune systems remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize a distinct quaternary retron system, Ec78, harboring a dual-component effector complex in which the PtuA ATPase and PtuB nuclease act in concert to mediate phage clearance. The cryo-EM structure of the Ec78 complex adopts a flower-basket-like architecture, with two Ec78 retrons engaging the PtuAB effector complexes through a msDNA-insertion assembly mechanism. Shortening of msDNA in length releases the PtuAB from Ec78 retron and triggers its activation. The cryo-EM structure of the retron-unbound effector complex further reveals an arginine-lysine finger loop on the PtuB nuclease that undergoes an ordered-to-disordered transition during enzymatic activation. These findings delineate the molecular basis underlying the Ec78 system in antiviral defense and highlight the mechanistic diversity of retron systems in prokaryotic immunity.",

Currently, all the necessary information for the geometric and physical treatment arrangement is collected during the commissioning phase, when a preliminary dosimetric characterization of the accelerator is performed for clinical use in accordance with international protocols. During this process, output factors (OFs)-correction factors that account for dose differences relative to the reference condition-are measured. Therefore, since treatment plans rely exclusively on the OF and experimental measurements can be affected by large errors (on the order of 30%), a tuned Monte Carlo model provides a valuable tool for treatment validation. It is particularly valuable for evaluating quantities that are difficult to measure directly, such as dose variations resulting from shielding disk misalignment (to protect underlying healthy tissue) or out-of-field exposure to organs at risk in complex clinical scenarios (e.g., patients with implantable electronic devices or during pregnancy).",

Although the R-CHOP regimen effectively cures 60-70% of patients, 30-40% of patients relapse or develop resistance, highlighting the need for new biomarkers to improve prognosis and therapeutic strategies. Members of the Acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) family are known to regulate various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cancer progression. However, the role of ACOT7 in DLBCL remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of ACOT7 in DLBCL. Using public database analysis and functional experiments, we found that ACOT7 is highly expressed in DLBCL tissues and is associated with poor patient prognosis. Silencing ACOT7 in DLBCL cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and regulated genes associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), while promoting apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we identified sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) as a transcriptional regulator of ACOT7, demonstrating that SREBF2 upregulates ACOT7 expression and promotes DLBCL progression. Our findings suggest that the SREBF2-ACOT7 axis plays a critical role in DLBCL by promoting tumor cell growth, invasion, and survival. ACOT7 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for DLBCL, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of this aggressive lymphoma.",

However, the mechanistic contribution of EP300 dysregulation to cancer is currently unknown. While EP300 has been implicated in regulating cell cycle and DNA replication, the role of EP300 in maintaining replication fork integrity has not been studied. Here, using EP300-mutated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells and an EP300-selective degrader, we reveal that EP300 loss leads to pronounced dysregulations in DNA replication dynamics and persistent genomic instability. Aberrant DNA replication in EP300-mutated cells is characterized by elevated replication origin firing due to replisome pausing. EP300 deficiency results in a prominent defect in fork protection resulting in the accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps. Importantly, we find that the loss of EP300 results in decreased expression of BRCA2 protein leading to sensitivity to treatments that are cytotoxic to BRCA-deficient cancers. Overall, we demonstrate that EP300-mutated cells recapitulate features of BRCA-deficient cancers.",

This study constructed ceRNA networks to identify molecular markers associated with NPC relapse. Three pairs of primary and relapse NPC tissue samples, along with their matched adjacent tissues, were collected for the RNA and miRNA sequencing, screened and identified relapse-related specific differentially expressed genes. We identified relapse-specific differentially expressed genes and functional analyses revealed enrichment in translation, biosynthesis, metabolism, TCA cycle, cell cycle, p53 signalling and immune pathways. Then these relapse-associated differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs were utilised to construct regulatory networks, resulting in a ceRNA network comprising 813 mRNAs, 143 lncRNAs, and 24 miRNAs, along with a survival-associated subnetwork of 23 mRNAs. Key mRNAs, such as UBC, PLA2R1, PTPRO, SMC5, PFN2, TIMM17B, NT5E and PCSK5, were validated via qPCR in NPC cell lines and tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study to construct a comprehensive ceRNA network specifically for posttreatment recurrent NPC.

This review integrates NP approaches, comprising organic (e.g. liposomes, polymeric NPs), inorganic (e.g. gold, iron oxide), carbon-based, and hybrid systems, to overcome disease-specific barriers. In AD, superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) and gold NPs (AuNPs) improve amyloid-beta plaque and tau protein detection, while liposomes precisely deliver anti-amyloid drugs. For PD, dopamine-loaded liposomes and cerium oxide NPs reinstate dopaminergic function and decrease oxidative stress, with improved motor outcomes. In MS, PEGylated liposomes and PLGA NPs regulate autoimmune responses, inducing remyelination and attenuating neuroinflammation. For BC, dendrimers and magnetic NPs facilitate targeted chemotherapy delivery across the BBB/BBTB, improving glioblastoma treatment outcomes. We compare NP types critically based on physicochemical characteristics, efficacy, toxicity, and clinical translation potential, highlighting gaps in long-term safety and scalability. Challenges like NP toxicity and regulatory complexities are discussed, suggesting biocompatible designs and standardized FDA/EMA pathways. By consolidating diagnostic and therapeutic innovations, this review outlines a roadmap for NP-based precision medicine, paving the way for clinical translation and better patient outcomes in CNS disorders and brain cancer.",

Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, multiple genetic modulators of LNP uptake is uncovered, with PIK3CA emerging as a top druggable target. Pharmacologic inhibition of PIK3CA with BAY1082439 - a clinically evaluated small molecule - significantly enhances LNP uptake, siRNA delivery, and gene silencing across diverse epithelial cancer cell lines in vitro. Co-administration of BAY1082439 with siRNA-loaded LNPs also better suppressed tumor growth and reduced liver inflammation in vivo, respectively. These findings establish PIK3CA inhibition as a broadly applicable strategy to boost LNP-mediated RNA interference and highlight the promise of combining functional genomics with nanomaterials to advance RNA-based therapeutics.",

The perioperative period offers an opportunity to intensify systemic therapy and potentially improve long-term outcomes. Early neoadjuvant trials of first-generation androgen deprivation therapy improved pathological findings, but not survival. Chemotherapy with docetaxel is feasible, with some evidence of a long-term benefit, but data for short-term endpoints remain inconclusive. The strongest evidence is from trials of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, which have revealed pathological downstaging, biological activity, and translational insights; the phase 3 PROTEUS trial will determine the impact of these agents on survival.

Herein, integrated multi-omics analyses of stool and blood samples from subjects from Pearl River Osteoarthritis Cohort (PROC, N = 207) are conducted to explore the potential gut-joint axis. Specifically, gut metagenomics, serum metabolomics and plasma proteomics are carried out. Knee synovitis is identified by magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 87 synovitis cases are identified in PROC, which are characterized by increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Alterations in microbial functions of both leucine and geraniol degradation are closely associated with increased serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and decreased geranic acid. These perturbations are significantly correlated with F/B ratio and down-regulated plasma TWEAK. Building upon these, the potential synovial targets are explored using a synovial single-cell dataset and the Nanjing Osteoarthritis Cohort (NOC, N = 22). Synovial fluid proteomics, histological analysis, and in vitro experiments with human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are conducted for NOC subjects with different synovitis grades. An upregulated TWEAK receptor is found in higher grade of synovitis. In vitro, higher TWEAK induced down-regulated TWEAK receptor in FLS. The study for the first time revealed the gut-joint axis in knee synovitis, providing new insight into potential targets for synovitis treatment.",

Mogamulizumab was administered as salvage therapy followed by valemetostat bridging therapy until allogeneic transplantation. Due to concerns about potential development of severe GVHD, mogamulizumab was withdrawn 70 days before transplantation and valemetostat was withdrawn 15 days before transplantation. Nevertheless, the patient developed acute GVHD (grade III (skin stage 3 gastrointestinal stage 2) 49 days after transplantation. The aGVHD was refractory to primary and secondary therapy, but symptoms improved with human mesenchymal stem cell treatment. Although valemetostat bridging therapy controlled ATLL and allowed for a treatment-free interval after mogamulizumab therapy, it delayed regulatory T cell (Treg) recovery and caused severe aGVHD. Further improvements are needed in the management of severe GVHD after mogamulizumab administration, such as monitoring of Tregs and residual mogamulizumab concentrations.",

A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with secondary CML in B-lymphoid blast phase 12 years after the onset of mucinous gland carcinoma of unknown origin. After resection of the carcinoma, he received chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He achieved a major molecular response with tyrosine kinase inhibitor and hyper CVAD/MA therapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in deep molecular response (DMR) approximately 1 year after the start of treatment. Twenty-six months later, he continues to maintain DMR under treatment with asciminib. Although the development of secondary CML is very rare, CML incidence is higher in patients with a history of cancer treatment. Consequently, it is important to be aware the risk of not only MDS/AML but also CML in this group.",

          "abstract": "A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 2021. She experienced early relapse after six cycles of R-THP-COP chemotherapy, but subsequently achieved complete response after four cycles of R-ESHAP. Regular follow-up care was continued. In May 2024, an elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) level was noted, and PET-CT revealed signs suggestive of relapse. Treatment with epcoritamab, a bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3, was initiated. While the therapy showed initial efficacy, the patient developed a fever at the beginning of the third treatment cycle, necessitating hospitalization. Upon admission, she exhibited altered mental status, and subsequent investigations, including bone marrow biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, confirmed the presence of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL, not otherwise specified: PTCL-NOS). The clinical course was aggressive, and the patient died of the disease on the 13th day of hospitalization. This case highlights the potential for aggressive T-cell lymphoma to emerge during bispecific antibody therapy, a phenomenon that has also been noted in the context of CAR-T cell therapy.",

Following one cycle of DeVIC therapy for tumor debulking, treatment with the bispecific antibody epcoritamab was initiated in May 2024. The lesion in the right cheek rapidly shrank, but the lesion in the left lower leg grew by day 3 of treatment. Without additional interventions, the left leg lesion shrank by day 14. After one cycle of epcoritamab, a CT scan showed a partial response in both lesions. Although histological confirmation was not obtained, the clinical course suggested that the left leg lesion represented pseudo-progression rather than true disease progression. This case indicates that pseudo-progression occurs during the early stages of treatment with bispecific antibodies, as is also observed in CAR-T therapy. Careful assessment is essential to avoid misinterpreting pseudo-progression as treatment failure and prematurely discontinuing effective therapy.",

          "abstract": "Oncolytic viruses, which kill tumor cells by tumor cell-specific replication, elicit superior antitumor immunity by efficiently activating the innate immune system. However, innate immunity-mediated inflammation is an undesirable consequence that often induces cellular production of immunosuppressive cellular factors. Among various immunosuppressive cellular factors, much attention has recently been focused on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In this study, we examined PGE2 production in human tumor cells following treatment with the mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 Dearing strain (hereafter reovirus), which has been used as an oncolytic virus in preclinical and clinical studies. Reovirus significantly induced PGE2 secretion from several types of human tumor cells in a virus titer-dependent manner. A nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor, BAY11-7082, and a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibitor, celecoxib, significantly inhibited PGE2 secretion, indicating that NF-κB and COX2 played a crucial role in reovirus-induced PGE2 production. Moreover, UV-irradiated reovirus (UV-Reo), which lost virus replication ability, did not increase PGE2 secretion. In addition, inhibitors of cathepsins B and L, cysteine lysosomal proteases crucial for reovirus replication, significantly reduced PGE2 secretion. These results indicate that reovirus replication in tumor cells is important for reovirus-induced PGE2 production. Attention should be paid to possible PGE2 production in tumors following reovirus treatment.",

Elevated expression of the plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (PLAUR) has been reported in several cancer types and is correlated with cancer progression. This study aims to evaluate the role of PLAUR in CRC and investigate its underlying mechanisms. We found that PLAUR expression was elevated across multiple cancer types, particularly in CRC, and consistently correlated with poor survival. Functional experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that PLAUR knockdown inhibited tumor cell growth, triggering G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conversely, PLAUR overexpression facilitated malignant phenotypes. Mechanistically, PLAUR depletion activated the p53 pathway, which was associated with reduced phosphorylated AKT. PLAUR knockdown led to significant downregulation of phosphorylated AKT and upregulation of p53 and p21 in CRC cells, suggesting the involvement of the AKT/p53 pathway. Rescue experiments confirmed that PLAUR promotes malignant progression in colorectal cancer via the AKT/p53 pathway. In summary, these findings highlight the potential of PLAUR as a prospective prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target in CRC.",

This review summarizes recent mechanistic advances showing how noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs)-including lncRNAs and circRNAs-cooperate with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to regulate ferroptosis, autophagy, lipid metabolism, immune evasion, and transcriptional programs. We highlight emerging principles involving RNA chemical modifications, structural elements, and liquid-liquid phase separation that define the specificity of ncRNA-RBP interactions. Recent multi-omics and spatial profiling technologies are also discussed for their role in revealing resistance-associated ncRNA-protein networks. Importantly, this review integrates these findings to outline actionable therapeutic opportunities and the translational potential of targeting ncRNA-RBP axes, emphasizing their relevance to precision oncology. By defining the key regulatory circuits that drive adaptive resistance, this work provides a conceptual framework that may guide biomarker development and personalized treatment strategies in HCC.",

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven cell death-has emerged as a central regulator of tumor biology and antitumor immunity in prostate, bladder, and renal cancers. Beyond direct cytotoxicity, it bidirectionally reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment. CD8+ and NK cells induce ferroptosis via IFN-γ-mediated suppression of system Xc-, whereas ferroptotic cells release DAMPs and antigens that mature dendritic cells and activate T cells. Conversely, ferroptosis in effector lymphocytes and tumor antioxidant, metabolic, and myeloid programs can enforce immune suppression. mRNA and lncRNA ferroptosis signatures stratify prognosis and immunotherapy response, often separating checkpoint-restrained \"hot\" tumors from immune-excluded/desert states. Mechanistic nodes (SLC7A11, GPX4, PRMT5, ATF4/NUPR1) and stromal/macrophage circuits link ferroptosis resistance to immune evasion. Emerging strategies combine ferroptosis induction with checkpoint blockade, adoptive cellular therapies, nano-delivery, and microenvironment reprogramming to convert \"cold\" disease into durable responders.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1980s, aromatase inhibitors (AI) have been a cornerstone in the management of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, because of their frequent co-prescription with antiresorptive agents, concerns have been raised regarding the potential contribution of AI to medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). We conducted a scoping review to investigate the possible association between AI use and MRONJ. Electronic searches were performed across five databases and supplemented with manual screening and gray literature. Observational studies and clinical trials were included. Fifty-four studies comprising 1,613,480 individuals (45,121 AI users) from 17 countries were analyzed. Most samples consisted of women with breast cancer/metastatic breast cancer in pre- and/or postmenopausal stages. Letrozole was the most frequently prescribed AI, followed by anastrozole and exemestane. MRONJ was reported in 43 studies, with 1,147 cases among 45,121 AI users (2.5% of AI users in the included samples), the majority of whom were concomitantly treated with zoledronic acid and/or denosumab. Three studies documented MRONJ in patients receiving AI monotherapy. Data demonstrate the difficulty of disentangling the effects of AI from those of antiresorptive therapy in MRONJ pathogenesis. Future research should consider AI as potential confounders in analytical studies to clarify their independent contribution, if any, to observed MRONJ occurrences.",

Patients will receive memantine 10 mg twice daily between the pre- and post-chemotherapy study assessments. Cognitive function will be assessed objectively using a computerized cognitive test (Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS) test) and a standard neuropsychological battery. To assess subjective cognitive function, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cognitive Function measure will be used. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, menopausal status, and sleep will be assessed as covariates.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as PEG-interferon alfa-2b, may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so it can be removed. Giving combination chemotherapy together with PEG-interferon alfa-2b after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving combination therapy together with PEG-interferon alfa-2b is more effective than two different combination chemotherapy regimens alone after surgery in treating osteosarcoma.",
